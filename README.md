SafetyTracker
=============
On friday we concluded on the way we were to set up the classes and how it was all going to communicate.
On friday night, Victor fixed a bug that was crashing the app that was caused by the GPS. After that was
cleared, I got the acceleration values and the orientation values to get passed to the engine.
Paul then explained an algorithm that will give us values that we need when we are going up hill or
down hill. Today, I worked on determining when we changed orientation and if it was a speed bump or going up
hill.Also what we do when we are on flat ground and when there is a bump. 
The code that was used to implement the flat ground was recycled from the begin activity that worked
when Garret,Victor and I went driving. I changed it up a little but have not tested. However, everything
seems to work as far as getting values and evaluating the diferent scenarios.

Con Amor,
Jose
